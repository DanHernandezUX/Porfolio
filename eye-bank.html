  <div class="col-md-2"><h3 class="project-heading">The Project:</h3></div>
  <div class="col-md-8"><p>In 2016 I helped redesign the website for the Lions Eye Bank of Wisconsin. The eye bank is not a financial institution, but rather the tissue processing center for posthumous donated corneal tissue.</p>

    <p>The website needed an overhaul because surgeons would come to the website to order tissue for surgery, but would not be able to navigate and find the forms or other information they needed.  Furthermore, other professional offices that worked with the eye bank could not request new supplies they needed.</p>

    <p>Without their supplies medical professionals could not recover tissue, which in turn would mean less inventory for surgeons, resulting in dollars lost.</p>

  <div class="col-md-2"><h3 class="project-heading">Main Flaws</h3></div>
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>The old website had a number of problems including an outdated and inconsitent design, poor information architecture with low information scent, and was built using an uncommon content management system. On top of that, very little people could tell knew what institution was by looking at the website. </p>

  <div class="col-md-8" style="opacity: 1;">
    <ol>
        <li>Refocus the navigation to make services such as ordering tissue and family support easier to find; Improve information scent</li><br>
    <li>Created a design system that included a larger, easier to read font, as well as consistent headings</li><br>
        <li>Brought information only found in brochures onto the page</li> <br>
        <li>Showcase stories of donation and explain clearly what the eye bank was</li>

  <div class="col-md-2"><h3 class="project-heading">Why I Did:</h3></div>
  <div class="col-md-8" style="opacity: 1;">
    <p>Putting the surgeons first was a given. If surgeons couldnt find what they needed, they would go somewhere else to get their supplies. The approximate value of each tissue sample was 2-5K. 5 surgeons not ordering tissue could easily result in a loss of 10k a week in reveneue.</p>

<p> As for the aesthetic improvements, I wanted to create a design with the look and feel that was brighter and cheerier. Tissue is only donated posthumous.</p>

<p> In conjunction, putting support for families and results of tissue donation more prominently could shift the conversation from the loss of a loved one, to the what they provided after passing. The site was simply not telling anyone what that story was for those who have donated, with it being an integral part of the business, I wanted to give that context on the home page front and center.</p>

  <div class="col-md-2"><h3 class="project-heading">What I Should Have Done:</h3></div>
  <div class="col-md-8"><p>Since this was my first big web re-design project and before I had a good understanding of UX and best practices I missed the mark on a few things. Notably the biggest - <strong>testing the navigation</strong></p>
    <p>I worked closely in a cross functional team including those whom worked with surgeons, nurses, coroners, family support, and volunteers to develop a navigation that made sense from an outside perspective. However at the end of the day, I was not the main user.</p>

<p>A simple card sort
for usability using a 3rd party would have given me more validity. I mainly took feedback from the technicians who worked with the surgeons if they were still unable to find things down the road.</p>
