 <div class="col-md-6"><h2>Overview</h2><p>The purpose of this project was to create a digital journey to guide users through an experience that would lead them to a  seldom used free financial fitness module with resources.</p></div>
 <div class="col-md-6"><h2>Goal</h2><p>Improve the number of participants who registered and interacted with the module.</p></div>

  <div class="col-md-8 fade"><p>The marketing team from the retirement services business engaged our team to assist in a campaign to encourage users to interact with a free module within their online retirement service. The purpose of the module is to help assess current financial fitness and provide free resources tailored to the age and income bracket of the user.</p>

    <p>The marketing team wanted to focus on targeting 3 separate age groups based on loosely defined personas from 18-34, 35-50 and 50+. Plan participants within each age group would receive  an email linking them to a microsite with articles catered to their age group. For example, the 50+ crowd had articles geared toward understanding social security, while the 18-34 group would have articles focused on budgeting and understanding debt repayments.</p>

   <h3>Solving For Engagement</h3>

  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-2 fade"><h3 class="project-heading">The Intended Solution</h3></div>
  <div class="col-md-8 fade"><p>The issue identified was that engagement with the module was low. The module is hosted behind the secured log-in environment and is difficult to find. From gathered data, we also were able to note that users do not typically log in to their accounts more than a handful of times per year. The approach identified was to create a micro-journey that would entice different user groups with free teaser content relevant to their respective age group and link them directly to the module.</p>
    <p>The ideal flow would look like something below:</p>

  <div class="col-md-2 fade"><h3 class="project-heading">Wireframe the Web Pages</h3></div>
  <div class="col-md-8 fade"><p>Once I fully understood the approach and requirements for the pages, I worked on the wireframes using provided content. After reviewing a few iterations, we settled on the following because it was a close match to the other article experiences that the users would have been familiar with from previous marketing efforts. The intent of the layouts were to:
<ul>
  <li>Add a header hierarchy to the page and article highlights to improve readability/scannability</li>
  <li>Create a consistent component system to improve speed to market</li>
  <li>Add a button instead of a text link to better showcase the CTA which was originally suggested</li>

  <div class="col-md-2 fade"><h3 class="project-heading">A Flaw in the Plan</h3></div>
  <div class="col-md-8 fade"><p>In order for this solution to operate correctly the user would need to be redirected to the module from the log in screen once they engaged in the call to action. Unfortunately, due to technical limitations we were unaware of at the time, IT was unable to create a redirect to the module from the log in because of a third party authentication service that the retirement service uses. When the user clicked the CTA -  they would be just brought to the log in page and then be brought to their retirement plan homescreen, and not the module.</p>
