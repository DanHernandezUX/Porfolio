  <div class="col-md-2"><h3 class="project-heading">The Project:</h3></div>
  <div class="col-md-8"><p>In early 2018, an internal business client approached our group to revamp their site. The business needs had outgrown the one page site they were using and wanted to create an experience that better reflected their place as a player in the venture capital space. Our team formulated a plan to meet the design needs by accomplishing the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Research and understand the needs of the intended user</li>
      <li>Create userflows</li>
      <li>Wireframe and prototype</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main user of the site was identified as a startup executive. The marketing team provided us with qualitative information regarding what types of content they heard as most desired from potential investees: a news section and portfolio to better understand whom the firm had invested in and if their company would be a good fit.</p>

  <div class="col-md-8"><img class="persona-image" src="images/exec.jpg" alt=""/><p class="emphasis">Timothy</p>
    <p><strong>Role</strong>: Start-up Executive</p>
    <p>Tim is an executive at a financial technology company seeking seed funding. He browses venture capital sites seeking funding from capital firms familiar with his business sector that have invested in similar companies.</p>

  <div class="col-md-2"><h3 class="project-heading">Address User and Business Needs</h3></div>
  <div class="col-md-8"><p>With an identified user persona, we decided to craft a navigation and home page that would allow those users to focus on information gathering and content that they desired most, stories like their own. The intent would be that people from potential companies would come to the table feeling more informed to discuss funding because they had already seen similar scenarios succeed on the site.</p>
    <p>Our frame focused on the user. However, we also wanted to ensure that we were addressing business needs, so our secondary focus was to make contacting simple.</p>

 <div class="container">
  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-2"><h3 class="project-heading">Sitemap</h3></div>
  <div class="col-md-8"><p>We structured the site in a way that kept learning at the forefront. Portfolio would help someone see the companies invested, news would showcase what companies were being invested in and how they were performing, and process would outline the typical steps that would result in funding. The case studies, 2 levels deep in the sitemap, would be geared towards a binging loop.</p>

What was most rewarding about this project was working with partners who were open to change and new ideas at every stage. Feeding off of the ideas and energy with this group helped this project move efficiently.</p>

For the site’s next steps, traffic analysis and site surveys would be helpful for us to start better understanding how users are navigating the site and what type of content on the site is getting the most traction.</p>
